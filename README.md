## 🍄 Hello there! I am Pippimotta. 
- 🧦 This name is taken from the splendid character Pippi Longstocking which I loved so much during my childhood.
  I hope I can grow up as her: kind, brave, fearless, and always being curious to new knowledge and this world.

- 🧠 I used to study Sociology and Transcutural studies in 3 countries. Focused on social movements, athropocene and Cyborg feminism. 
- 😺 But currently it is coding that helps me reclaim the sense of intergrity and the pleasure of learning.
- 👀 I’m looking companions to study coding and data science together.
- 🍂 How to reach me: lingyizh84@gmail.com
