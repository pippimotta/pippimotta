## 🍄 Hello there! I am Pippimotta.
- 🧦 This name is taken from the splendid character *Pippi Longstocking* which I loved so much during my childhood.
  I hope I can grow up as her: kind, brave, fearless, and always being curious about new knowledge and this world.

- 🧠 I used to study Sociology and Transcultural studies in 3 countries. Focusing on social movements, Athropocene and Cyborg feminism.
- 😺 But currently it is coding that helps me reclaim the sense of intergrity and the pleasure of learning (as a prideful ADHDer)
- ✏️ Recently working on Algorithm and React
- 🍂 How to reach me: lingyizh84@gmail.com
